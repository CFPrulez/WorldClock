# World Clock (Android App)
Great app from Rahul Agarwal but unfortunately no updated since 2012. I’ll implement some bug fixes and features that I’d like to have in this app — I share the changes with you. Maybe some of these will be merged to the original project as well…

## New in version 0.7
* Bugfix: UTF-8 characters are displayed correctly
* Enhancement: 12/24 hours formatting is now done using the system settings 
* Improvement: Build with new SDK — same code, new design

## Roadmap
TODOs (some may be implemented in the future):

- [x] ~~New SDK for new UI~~
- [x] ~~Support for non-ASCII characters~~
- [x] ~~12/24 hour format depending on system settings~~
- [ ] Update About section
- [ ] More material design elements (FAB)
- [ ] Sort by datetime not "random"
- [ ] Custom sorting
- [ ] Provide apk/Merge into upstream
