# World Clock (Android App)
Great app from Rahul Agarwal but unfortunately no updated since 2012. I’ll implement some bug fixes and features that I’d like to have in this app — I share the changes with you. Maybe some of these will be merged to the original project as well…

## New in version 0.8
* Enhancement: Custom sorting 
* Design: Introduce FloatingActionButton

The FAB requires minSdk 21 (Android Lollipop, 5.0). If you use a phone with an older Android version you have to build the app without commit [132e696](https://github.com/CFPrulez/WorldClock/commit/132e696e38e96f64d5d726b123c34ef5237e32bf).

## New in version 0.7
* Bugfix: UTF-8 characters are displayed correctly
* Enhancement: 12/24 hours formatting is now done using the system settings 
* Improvement: Build with new SDK — same code, new design

## Roadmap
TODOs (some may be implemented in the future):

- [x] ~~New SDK for new UI~~
- [x] ~~Support for non-ASCII characters~~
- [x] ~~12/24 hour format depending on system settings~~
- [x] ~~Update About section~~
- [x] ~~Material design elements (FAB)~~
- [x] ~~Custom sorting~~
- [ ] More material design elements (ActionBar, Swipe)
- [ ] Provide apk/Merge into upstream
